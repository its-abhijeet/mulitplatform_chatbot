# Multi-Channel Communication Platform with AI Chatbot
## Problem Statement

### Project Overview
The client requires a comprehensive communication platform that integrates multiple channels including email, WhatsApp, and web chat into a unified system. The platform needs to enable mass communication while providing detailed analytics and reporting capabilities. Additionally, an AI-powered chatbot is required to handle routine inquiries and support requests automatically.

### Current Challenges
Organizations today face several communication challenges:
1. **Fragmented Communication Channels**: Managing separate systems for email, messaging, and chat creates operational inefficiencies.
2. **Limited Visibility**: Lack of unified analytics across channels prevents data-driven decision making.
3. **Resource Constraints**: Customer support teams are overwhelmed with routine inquiries that could be automated.
4. **Inconsistent Messaging**: Without centralized templates and tracking, messaging becomes inconsistent across channels.
5. **Compliance Concerns**: Meeting GDPR and other regulatory requirements across multiple communication platforms is challenging.
